It combines elements of electronics and communications engineering and computer science to understand the hardware/software interface common to computing and information systems. A computer engineer may perform tasks such as the design of a microprocessor or the development of an embedded system that may be used in applications that range from desktops to hand-held devices.</p>

The parent discipline of Computer Engineering is Electrical Engineering with which it shares considerable commonality. Computer Engineering seeks to match efficient digital devices with appropriate software to meet the scientific, technological and administrative needs of business and industry in a global economy. The program provides students with a background that prepares them for careers in embedded systems design, computer system operations, and systems support.</p>
                            <p class = "fs-5 text-white">The Computer Engineering curriculum provides students with a foundation in basic science, mathematics and the humanities. Written and oral communication skills are emphasized and developed throughout the program, as is team project work (laboratory experiments, reports, and thesis) and an appreciation of the ethical and professional responsibilities of an engineer. The program also includes a one-trimester practicum in a locally or internationally recognized engineering or computing institution.</p>

For example, real-time operating systems are systems that respond to input immediately. They are used for such tasks as navigation, in which the computer must react to a steady flow of new information without interruption. Most general-purpose operating systems are not real-time because they can take a few seconds, or even minutes, to react.Real time can also refer to events simulated by a computer at the same speed that they would occur in real life. In graphics animation, for example, a real-time program would display objects moving across the screen at the same speed that they would actually move.</p>

Long touted as the future revolution in computing, multimedia applications were, until the mid-90s, uncommon due to the expensive hardware required.
